# **Amplitude Levels in Relation to Bit Depth**
![]()
Hello! My name is Julie To and I am an Information Technology student here at Mizzou! This page will navigate you to a series of pages thaat will teach you how to calculate how many different amplitude levels can be recorded, knowing the bit depth. It also gives background on bits and amplitude. This tutorial is aimed towards anyone that is beginning their journey in pursuing the IT field.
