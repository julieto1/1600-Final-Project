# **What is a bit?**
![]()
A bit is the most basic and smallest form of a unit within technology and the smallest form of data that a computer can store. A bit is like a light switch. It is either off or on. The state of which it is on, is represented by a one. The state in which it is off, is represented by a zero.

You may hear the words byte more often in your studies. 8 bits make up a single byte. So if you have 10 bytes, you also have 80 bits.

The term "bit depth" refers to the number of bits needed to represent either an amplitude or a color.
