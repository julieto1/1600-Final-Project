# **How to Calculate**

The calculation to find how many amplitude levels can be recorded with the bit depth, is incredibly simple. 

All you have to do is you take the bit depth, and you raise 2 to the power of the bit depth.

For example, if the bit depth is 8. 2^8 is 256. So you can record 256 different amplitude levels!
